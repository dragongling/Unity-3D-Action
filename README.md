**What the plan?**  
To learn gamedev, make a gameplay prototype, test various mechanics of 3D action games. When consistent and enjoyable prototype will be finished, 
I'll make another private repository for commercial product. This repo will always stay open and MIT licensed.  
If commercial project will succeed, I'll continue with my gamedev business. 
If it will fail, I'll have this as portfolio to find a job.

**What the gameplay will focus on?**  
The first goal is to implement and test 3D space traversing mechanics along with level design concepts for it. 
I consider boring and/or slow level traversing as the flaw of many games. 
And I personally like fast and skilled traversing, so I'm motivated to implement it.  
After it I'll decide what to work on next.

**Why Unity?**  
I need a free engine to focus on gameplay prototyping, not to learn, develop or test some engine. 
Could be Godot, but finding a job as Godot developer is much harder as backup plan. 
With some money and time in future I'll consider to develop free assets for Godot.
